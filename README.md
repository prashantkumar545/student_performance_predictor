## 📖 Overview
The **Student Performance Prediction App** is a web-based tool designed to help educators, researchers, and students analyze and predict academic outcomes.  
Users can input key factors (like study time, attendance, and previous scores), and the app predicts the student’s final performance using a pre-trained machine learning model.

> 🌟 This project demonstrates the power of **Data Science +  basic Web Development +  Basic Cloud Deployment**.

## ✨ Features
✅ Simple and clean **web interface**  
✅ **Real-time predictions** powered by a pre-trained ML model  
✅ **Flask backend** for handling requests and inference  
✅ **Responsive design** with custom CSS  
✅ Easy to **deploy on PythonAnywhere**  
✅ Lightweight & beginner-friendly project structure

## 🤖 Model Details
- The ML model was trained to predict **student academic performance** based on factors like:
  - Study hours
  - Attendance
  - Past scores
  - Socio-economic and demographic factors (if provided)

- Saved as: `Student_Performance_model.pickle`
- Integrated directly into the Flask app for fast predictions.
